**Author:** Lukas Javorsky  
**Student ID:** xjavor20  
**School:** BUT FIT  
**Subject:** IZA (Programming Apple Devices)  
**Application language:** SwiftUI

## Purpose
This application is a school project that is targeted to exercise and try application creation in Swift language.  
In my case I wanted to try new perspection of Swift programming that is called SwiftUI.  
Also in this project we should try to use CoreData library and work with database data.  

## Aplication usage
The aplication is ment to be used as a interactive dictionary for student rating.  
For example if you have a scoring exercice you can use this to note the scores of every individual in your class.  
The rating are stored in a database, that is linked with this application, it means that data are persistent.

This screen is displayed just once, when the application is first launched.  
It should help the user to have some kind of idea how to use the app.

#### Editing the records of the students

There are **two ways** of deleting the student's record.  
**First** is to click an `edit` button, then select your record and click at `delete`.  
**Second** is to slide the record to the left and it will be automaticly deleted.
